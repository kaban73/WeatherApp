# WeatherApp
**WeatherApp** is a simple application to view the weather in your city. For this app we need an internet connection and access to geolocation <br />
 It has been developed using the **Retrofit, MVVM, Navigation, LiveData, TDD and OpeanWeatherMapApi** <br />
**P.S.** <em>unfortunately, at the moment(21.07.24) the OpeanWeatherMapApi does not work on the territory of the Russian Federation, so you will have to use a vpn</em>
